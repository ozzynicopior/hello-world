# hello-world
Just trying to re-create the tutorial steps in this link: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
